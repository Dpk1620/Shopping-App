## Features
- Customers can see the list of products with their price and category
- App should have a facility that allows user to filter products based on their category and price range

- When clicked on cart button list of products added in the cart should be visible with their quantity and price
- User should be able to increase and decrease the quantity using '+' and '-' buttons in cart
- Added products can be purchased using mock payment(just update a key in DB)
- Customers can access their purchase history with given time-frame.
## Things to keep in mind ðŸš¨

Also we would like you to use git repo when you start coding so we can check your commits and your fluency with github/gitlab
