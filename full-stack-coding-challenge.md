# Full-Stack Coding Challenge
## Idea of the App
The task is to implement a small commercial webapp that will allow user to browse through the list of products available.
In addition to that, they can also add products to the cart and purchase them as a mock payment.
## Features
- Customers can see the list of products with their price and category
- App should have a facility that allows user to filter products based on their category and price range
- Customers should be able to add products to the cart
- When clicked on cart button list of products added in the cart should be visible with their quantity and price
- User should be able to increase and decrease the quantity using '+' and '-' buttons in cart
- Added products can be purchased using mock payment(just update a key in DB)
- Customers can access their purchase history with given time-frame.
## Things to keep in mind ðŸš¨
Your code will be evaluated on:
- whether the technologies required are used
- code structure
- programming best practices
- legibility
- appearance
- rendering performance
- database schema

Also we would like you to use git repo when you start coding so we can check your commits and your fluency with github/gitlab. Add a separate commit so we know how you use commit standards and at same time how good you can breakup tasks while doing commit of code.
## Technologies to use
We'd like to see your implementation using the following technologies:
## FrontEnd
- React (hooks)
- Redux (redux-toolkit)
- React-query or any other similar client
- MUI or Bootstrap
- Typescript

**Note:** Focus more on business logic instead of styling your app

## BackEnd
- Express / Nest with Typescript
- Mongodb or any other SQL database of your choice
- If not sharing project in typescript please do mention that before hand


## How to submit the challenge solution?
After you finished your app, please follow the instructions below:
1. Share your repository link to us - can be a public repository on gitlab or github
2. Mention the time you spent on this
3. You can use any boilerplate from internet instead of setting up own from scratch to save time.
